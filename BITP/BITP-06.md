# BITP-06: Liquidity Provider(LP)

`author: 22388o` `mandatory` `final`

In a DEX-style Uniswap scenario implemented using the RGB protocol, liquidity providers play a crucial role in maintaining liquidity within the platform. 

1. Liquidity Pool Creation: Liquidity providers contribute their RGB tokens to liquidity pools within the DEX. These pools are designed to facilitate asset swapping. Liquidity providers deposit a proportional amount of each asset into the pools, ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity for trading.

2. Swap Mechanism: Users of the DEX can initiate swaps between different RGB tokens. When a user wants to swap one asset for another, the swap mechanism calculates the trade based on the liquidity available in the pools and the current prices of the assets. The swap mechanism determines the optimal asset exchange, taking into account the ratios of assets within the liquidity pools.

3. Automated Market Making: The DEX operates based on an automated market making algorithm, similar to Uniswap. This algorithm maintains a constant product of the assets within the liquidity pools. When users perform swaps, the algorithm adjusts the asset prices based on the changing supply and demand dynamics, ensuring efficient and fair trading.

4. Liquidity Provider Rewards: Liquidity providers earn rewards for contributing to the liquidity pools. These rewards can come in the form of transaction fees collected from trades within the DEX. When users perform swaps, a portion of the traded assets is collected as fees and distributed to the liquidity providers as an incentive for providing liquidity. The rewards can be paid out in the form of additional RGB tokens or other tokens native to the DEX.

5. Impermanent Loss Protection: In order to incentivize liquidity providers and protect them against impermanent loss, the DEX can introduce additional mechanisms. Impermanent loss occurs when the value of assets in a liquidity pool changes relative to holding them outside the pool. The DEX may introduce reward mechanisms or insurance mechanisms to mitigate the impact of impermanent loss for liquidity providers.

By incorporating liquidity providers within the DEX using the RGB protocol, the platform can ensure sufficient liquidity for asset swapping. Liquidity providers are incentivized through transaction fee rewards, which encourage them to contribute assets to the liquidity pools. This ecosystem benefits both traders who can execute swaps and liquidity providers who earn rewards for their participation.


## Implementation

Based on RGB-20 from [RGB-20: Fungible assets](https://standards.lnp-bp.org/rgb/lnpbp-0020)

```phyton
interface RGB20
    global spec :: RGBContract.DivisibleAssetSpec

    public inflationAllowance* :: Zk64
    public updateRight?
