*Bifrost is an extension to the LN peer-to-peer protocol, which would allow you to send client-side validation data using the LN itself, make RGB-20 payments over the LN and enable more advanced things in the future: DEX, decentralized storage, DeFi, advanced smart contracts etc.*

## Why for Bitswap is important?

- Provide multipeer channels and oracles over LN with RGB20
- P2P  infrastructure
- Storage information over L3 by Storm protocol
- Own API and RPCs
- Compatible with LN existent implementations like LND, CLN...
